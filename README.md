# Sphaerularia - RNA-Seq
RNA-Seq analyses of bumblebee queens infected by the nematode, _Sphaerularia bombi_  

This repository contains scripts for the analysis of infected _Bombus terrestris_ queens.  
These scripts are modifications of scripts used by Colgan et el. (2019, _Molecular Ecology_). 

The results of this analysis are described in:  
Colgan, T.J., Carolan,J.C., Sumner, S., Blaxter, M.L., Brown. M.J.F. The entomoparasitic nematode, _Sphaerularia bombi_, alters gene expression in a key pollinator, _Bombus terrestris_ [in prep]
