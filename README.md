RNA-Seq analyses of bumblebee queens infected by the nematode, _Sphaerularia bombi_  

This repository contains scripts for the analysis of infected _Bombus terrestris_ queens.  
These scripts are modifications of scripts used by Colgan et el. (2019, _Molecular Ecology_). 
If reusing scripts within the present repository, please cite the original source as well and follow instructions on reuse.
