The following folder contains a script for the pseudoalignment and quantification of raw reads against the predicted transcriptome of the bumblebee _Bombus terrestris_.  
Pseudoalignment was performed using the k-mer based probabilistic pseudoaligner, [Kallisto](https://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/).
