The following folder contains scripts for differential expression analysis from estimated counts generated by the pseudoaligner, [Kallisto](https://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/).  
Estimated counts for transcripts for each samples were quantified to gene-level estimated counts using the R package, [tximport](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/tximport.html).  
Using these gene-level estimated counts, differential expression analysis was performed using [DESeq2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html).
